      The <b>Silkie</b> (also known as the <b>Silky</b> or
      <b>Chinese silk chicken</b>) is a breed of chicken named for its
      atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The
      breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones,
      blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have
      four.

        The number 2 is “Bring it home”—vital <br />
        for me, deadly for you. See, I am <br />
        <br />
        a chef, full of pluck, using only <br />
        the freshest of ingredients. <br />
        <br />
        If I bring you home, it will be <br />
        straight to the kitchen.<br />
        <br />
        My grocery list says tamari sauce, <br />
        cilantro, and, worst of all, <br />
        <br />
        garlic, all of which spell <br />
        a poem you may not want to read.
